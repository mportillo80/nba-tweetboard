## Overview

Based on a faux API, check which NBA teams and players are the most popular according to Twitter every 15 seconds based on mentions.

## Roadmap

Expand on concept to incorporate the following:

* Pull from official Twitter API (mentions/retweets)
* Pull NBA player data from an existing API
* Adjust leaderboard design to show NBA player team logos and player profile pictures (circular)
* Possibly pull from NBA 2k ratings data (no official source) to compare to popularity
* Allow for display of top tweets
* Pause timer functionality (or set manually)
* Add favicon (because why not)
